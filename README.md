## :clipboard: Description

Sing Me A Song is an application for anonymous song recommendation where the user can create their own recommendations and vote for the best ones. The more people like a recommendation, the more likely it is to be recommended to others.
In this project, I focus solely on the development of the necessary tests, with the front-end and back-end of the application not being coded by me.

## :desktop_computer: Technologies and Concepts

- End-to-end testing with Cypress
- Unitary and integration tests with Jest

---

## üèÅ Running the application

This project was initialized with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so make sure you have the latest stable version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) running locally.

First, clone this repository on your machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/LaraCamarino/Projeto_21_SingMeASong.git
```

Then, navigate to both the front-end and back-end folder and run the following command on each folder to install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

After that is done, just initialize both the front-end and the back-end servers:

### Front-end

```
npm start
```

### Back-end

```
npm run dev
```

Now you can run the tests.
